# SUPHRA Recommendation Generator
A tool to extract, upload, and maintain productivity and health recommendations from scientific papers. Each LLM-generated recommendation source information from [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) will be assigned.

## 📖How to use
**1. Set up keys.**
To generate recommendations you necessarily need to add an [OpenAi API key](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/), since OpenAi´s GPT models are the only supported models so far. A [Semantic Scholar API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) is also required for usage.
To set up your keys just fill in `.env` like it is done in [.env.template](/.env.template).

**2. Set up URL to your Database**
Fill in the DATABASE_URL field in your `.env` following [SQLAlchemy's convention](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#:~:text=various%20backends%20available.-,Database%20URLs%C2%B6,-The%20create_engine()).

**3. Feed your papers.** 
To hand in your scientific papers just select them via the drag-and-drop field in the 'Extraction' view. It is recommended to not upload too many documents at once since you will probably lose track of them. Start with 1-2 papers to see how it works.

**4. Choose a model.** The only model that is currently supported is OpenAIs GPT-4o-mini. Depending on requirements, more models will be added. Be sure to provide the required keys for the chosen model.

**5. Generate!** Click on *Generate Recommendations* and the model will analyze what you have given towards it.

The prompt that is used for the generation is based on [this instructions text](./data/instructions/paper_to_rec_inst.txt). To keep a clear output structure function calling is used (see *tools* in [generate.py](./tip_generator/)).
